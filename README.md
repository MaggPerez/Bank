# The Revised Project Proposal



## Theme
The theme is a Bank where we will create an App that allows users to create a Bank Account to deposit and withdraw money and to be able to see their transaction log


## Feature List
1. The user will create a username and password from the beginning which will be stored. Once the user logs into the app. Their name will be displayed.

2. There will be two accounts: Checking and Saving. The user will have the option to pick both account and either deposit or withdraw their money. 

3. Once the user has done deposits or withdrawals, they will be able to see their transaction logs based on their activities.
