# The Project Proposal



## Theme
The theme is a Bank where we will create an App that allows users to create a Bank Account to deposit and withdraw money and to determine if the user is a customer or employee.


## Feature List
1. Create an Account
- The user will create a Username and Password and an option that tells the user if they are a customer or employee.


2. Main Menu (For Customer)
- In the Customer's perspective, the app will display their _Username_, give options to _Deposit and Withdraw_ money, and _logout_ the App.

3. Main Menu (For Employee)
- In the Employee's perspective, the app will display their _Username_, _Deposit and Withdraw_, and _logout_ options.
